A deafening silence spreads upon the forest as you see an ominous structure to the east.
Tall trees stretch overhead, their branches weaving together to form a canopy that dims the already faint starlight. All is quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves. You can feel the piercing cold seep into your bones.
The night sky struggles to filter through the tangled branches. The absolute silence of the forest reminds you just how little you can see.

The forest floor is soft with fallen leaves, and the canopy overhead gives the area a muted, tranquil feel. You get the sense that you are the first to set foot here in a long, long time.

The forest grows denser as you walk, darkness deepening under the trees which obscure the night sky, leaving prickles in your spine.

You pause as the underbrush seems disturbed, and something unnatural peeks out from the leaves.
Thick vines drape over the branches, tangled and knotted like a colossal web. The forest feels dense and ancient, as if it's been untouched for generations.
